*   **`dashboard.html` (Dashboard):**  Presents a visual dashboard displaying key donation statistics, such as total donations, number of donors, donation progress, and charts illustrating donation trends over time and by cause.
*   **`donate.html` (Donate Page):**  Offers a donation form where users can select a cause, specify the donation amount, and enter their personal details to make a donation.
*   **`donations.html` (Donation History Page):** Displays a table listing all donation records, showing details like date, donor name, email, cause, and amount.
*   **`styles.css` (Stylesheet):** Contains CSS rules to style the HTML elements and define the visual appearance of the website.
*   **`js/main.js` (JavaScript):** Includes JavaScript code to handle form submissions on the donate page, store donation data in local storage, and dynamically populate the donation history table and dashboard charts.

    *   **JavaScript Inclusion:** Includes `<script src="js/main.js"></script>` to link to the `main.js` file, which contains the `displayDonationHistory()` function to populate the table.

#### `styles.css` - Stylesheet

*   **Purpose:**  Provides custom CSS styles to enhance the visual presentation of the HTML pages.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Basic Styling:** Sets default font family, background color, text color, and line height for the `body`.
    *   **Container Styling:** Styles the `.container` class, likely used to wrap content sections, with properties for `max-width`, `margin`, `padding`, `background-color`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow`.

    *   **Responsive Design:**  Includes a media query (`@media (max-width: 600px)`) to adjust container margins and header font size for smaller screens, making the design responsive.

#### `js/main.js` - JavaScript

*   **Purpose:** Contains JavaScript code to handle donation form submission and display donation history.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Donation Form Submission Handler:**
        *   Attaches an event listener to the `donate-form` (if it exists).
        *   Prevents default form submission.
        *   Retrieves values from the form fields (cause, amount, donorName, donorEmail).
        *   Creates a `donationDetails` object with the collected data and the current date.
        *   Retrieves existing donations from local storage, parses them from JSON, or initializes an empty array if no donations exist.
        *   Pushes the new `donationDetails` object to the `donations` array.
        *   Stores the updated `donations` array back into local storage as a JSON string.
        *   Redirects the user to `donations.html`.
    *   **`displayDonationHistory()` Function:**
        *   Retrieves the table body element (`donationTableBody`).
        *   Retrieves donations from local storage and parses them from JSON.
        *   Iterates through the `donations` array and dynamically generates table rows (`<tr>`) for each donation record.
        *   Inserts table data cells (`<td>`) for date, donor name, donor email, cause, and amount within each row.
        *   Appends the generated HTML for each row to the `innerHTML` of the `donationTableBody`.
    *   **Conditional History Display:**
        *   Checks if the current page URL path includes `donations.html`.
        *   If true, calls the `displayDonationHistory()` function to populate the donation history table when the `donations.html` page is loaded.

### 3. Key Features

*   **Donation Collection:**
    *   Users can easily donate through the `donate.html` page.
    *   The donation form is simple and collects essential information: cause, amount, name, and email.
    *   Donations are stored locally using `localStorage`, which is suitable for demonstration purposes but not for a production environment.
*   **Dashboard:**
    *   Provides a visual summary of donation data on `dashboard.html`.
    *   Displays key metrics like total donations, donor count, and progress towards the donation goal.
    *   Includes charts to visualize donation trends over time and distribution by cause, enhancing data understanding.
*   **Donation History:**
    *   `donations.html` page presents a clear table view of all donation records.
    *   Displays donation date, donor information, cause, and amount, offering a detailed history of contributions.

### 4. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **HTML:**  Provides the structure and content of the web pages.
    *   **CSS:**  Styles the visual presentation of the website, making it user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
    *   **JavaScript:**  Adds interactivity to the website, handles form submissions, data storage, and dynamic content rendering.
*   **CSS Framework:**
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid UI development and consistent styling across the website.
*   **Chart Library:**
    *   **Chart.js:**  A JavaScript charting library used to create interactive charts on the dashboard, visualizing donation data.
*   **Data Storage (Client-Side):**
    *   **`localStorage`:**  Used for storing donation data directly in the user's browser. This is a simple approach for demonstration or small-scale projects but is not suitable for production due to data persistence and scalability limitations.

### 5. Potential Improvements

*   **Backend Integration:**
    *   **Problem:**  `localStorage` is not persistent across different browsers or devices and data can be lost if browser data is cleared. It's also not scalable for real-world applications.
    *   **Solution:** Implement a backend server with a database (e.g., Node.js with Express and MongoDB, Python with Flask/Django and PostgreSQL). This would allow for persistent data storage, server-side data processing, and scalability.
*   **User Authentication:**
    *   **Enhancement:** Implement user authentication for both donors and administrators.
        *   **Donors:**  Optional registration/login for donors to view their donation history and manage profiles.
        *   **Administrators:** Secure login for NGO staff to access and manage donation data, generate reports, and configure the system.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration:**
    *   **Functionality:** Integrate a real payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process online donations securely.
    *   **Benefits:**  Enable real financial transactions, provide secure payment processing, and offer donors various payment methods.
*   **Enhanced Dashboard:**
    *   **Features:** Expand the dashboard with more detailed analytics and reporting features.
        *   **Filters and Date Ranges:** Allow administrators to filter data by date ranges, causes, and other criteria.
        *   **Downloadable Reports:**  Enable generation and download of donation reports in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
        *   **More Chart Types:**  Incorporate additional chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to visualize data from different perspectives.
*   **Accessibility:**
    *   **Improvement:** Enhance website accessibility to comply with WCAG guidelines.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Ensure proper semantic HTML structure.
        *   Provide alternative text for images.
        *   Improve keyboard navigation.
        *   Ensure sufficient color contrast.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **Implementation:** Implement unit tests for JavaScript functions and integration tests for UI components.
    *   **Benefits:**  Improve code quality, reduce bugs, and ensure the system functions as expected after modifications.

### 6. Conclusion

The NGO Management System project provides a basic yet functional web interface for managing NGO donations. It effectively utilizes HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript (Chart.js) to create a user-friendly donation platform with a dashboard for data visualization and a history page for record-keeping.

While the current implementation using `localStorage` is suitable for small-scale demonstrations, transitioning to a backend-based architecture with a database and payment gateway integration is crucial for a robust, scalable, and secure production-ready system. Further enhancements like user authentication, an expanded dashboard, accessibility improvements, and comprehensive testing would significantly improve the system's functionality and usability for both donors and the NGO administrators.
